# heat_simulation_proc

This C++ project was completed during the first year of the Master's program in CSMI at the University of Strasbourg. The objective was to simulate heat transfer in a processor heat sink (ailette) for both stationary and non-stationary cases.
 Additionally, the project includes code for visualizing the heat transfer process by generating VTK files, which can be viewed as a video using software like ParaView.
For more details, please refer to the project report available in the file: rapport_projet.pdf in the repository.
